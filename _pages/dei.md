<p align = "justify">As a researcher in systems neuroscience, I recognize the longstanding and systemic barriers that have prevented women and people of color from fully participating and being represented in the field. I acknowledge that our field has not always been welcoming to diverse perspectives.</p>

<p align = "justify">In the lab, we aim to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for people of all backgrounds, particularly those historically excluded from research in neuroscience. Diversity drives innovation and fosters scientific excellence. We actively work to promote equity in our recruitment, training, and mentoring practices, with a focus on increasing representation of women and people of color in neuroscience.</p>
  
<p align = "justify">We continuously educate ourselves on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and engage in discussions facilitated by our diversity reading group. By embracing diversity and promoting inclusion, we will drive innovative discoveries and improve the lives of individuals of all backgrounds.</p>
