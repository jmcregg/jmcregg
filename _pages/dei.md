<p align = "justify">As a researcher in systems neuroscience, I recognize the longstanding and systemic barriers that have prevented women and people of color from fully participating and being represented in the field. I acknowledge that our field has not always been welcoming to diverse perspectives, and I am committed to taking proactive steps to address this.</p>

<p align = "justify">In the lab, we are committed to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for individuals of all backgrounds, particularly those who have historically been excluded from our field. We recognize that diversity drives innovation and fosters scientific excellence. We actively work to promote equity in our recruitment, training, and mentoring practices, with a focus on increasing the representation of women and people of color in the lab and in systems neuroscience more generally.</p>
  
<p align = "justify">We continuously educate ourselves on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and actively engage in discussions and initiatives that support these values. We believe that by embracing diversity and promoting inclusion, we will drive innovative discoveries and improve the lives of individuals of all backgrounds.</p>
